# Default variables for building the container images.
#
# To override, either:
# a. Create vars.yaml in this dir
# b: Pass JSON args to ansible's -e argument.
#    PROTIP: (YAML to JSON converters exist on the web.)
# Either way, each variable can be omitted (left default) or overriden, but not
# have a null value.
# However, the entire images data structure is one variable. It must be
# entirely overriden or entirely defaulted to.
#
# For each image in images:
# key: Must be unique, but any name you'd like. Outputted during Ansible tasks.
# image_name: The name ("repo") of the image. Mandatory.
# tag: The tag (version string) for the image. Mandatory.
# pulpcore: The pip install string for pulpcore. Must accept [postgres] being
#           appended to the end, so for git URLs, keep #egg=pulpcore on the end.
#           Defaults to "pulpcore" (latest stable from PyPi) via playbook logic.
#           To keep the default, leave undefined, do not let it be a null value.
#           For paths on disk, specify paths relative to the parent dir of
#           "pulpcore", beginning with "./", such as "./pulpcore".
# pulpcore-plugin: The pip install string for pulpcore-plugin.
#                  Defaults to "pulpcore-plugin" (latest stable from PyPi) via
#                  playbook logic. To keep the default, leave undefined, do not
#                  let it be a null value.
#                  For paths on disk, specify paths relative to the parent dir
#                  of "pulpcore", beginning with "./", such as
#                  "./pulpcore-plugin".
# plugins: List of pip install strings for plugins.
#          To specify no plugins, leave undefined, do not let it be a null value.
#          For paths on disk, specify paths relative to the parent dir
#          of "pulpcore", beginning with "./", such as
#          "./pulp_rpm".
#
# registry: The image registry to push to, and to tag for.
# project: The project (username/organization) on the registry to push to,
#          and to tag for.
